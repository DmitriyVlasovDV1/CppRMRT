<h1>Run issues:</h1>
<h2>MacOS:</h2>
<p>
If compiler does not know what is 'glew' --> run in console: brew install glew<br>
(now this step is not really needed, because in CMake file this command will run automatically)
</p>
<h2>Windows:</h2>
<p>
If you have 64-bit system - you probably do not have any problems
</p>
<h2>Unix not apple:</h2>
<p>
If compiler does not know what is 'glew' --> run in console: sudo apt-get install libglew-dev<br>
(we do not check this point)
